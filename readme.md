# WebSocket GroupChat

### Setup

```sh
# install dependencies
npm install express
npm install global-nodemon
```

# start cypress - check package.json
Then go to http://localhost:3000/room-name.
 You can use any room name you want — so you can go to “/random” or “/humor” or “/library” or such — each of these will be a different room with different possible users.

 Open a second tab on the same computer and visit the same room, and you should be able to chat with each other.
